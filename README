NAME
    Carp::Always::Dump - (DEPRECATED) Like Carp::Always, but dumps the
    content of function arguments

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.07 of Carp::Always::Dump (from Perl
    distribution Carp-Always-Dump), released on 2015-01-06.

SYNOPSIS
     % perl -MCarp::Always::Dump script.pl

DESCRIPTION
    NOTICE: This module is deprecated. The same functionality is in
    Devel::Confess:

     % perl -d:Confess=dump ...

    This module will be removed from CPAN.

VARIABLES
  $Color => BOOL (default: from COLOR environment, or 1)
    If set to true, will use terminal colors to help visually distinguish
    parameters from one another.

  $DumpObj => BOOL (default: 0)
    If set to 1, will dump objects (blessed references) instead of showing
    them as 'Foo::Bar=HASH(0x19c8ff8)'.

  $MaxArgLen => INT (default: 0)
    Like $MaxArgLen in Carp, to limit the number of characters of dump to
    show.

  $Terse => BOOL (default: 1)
    If set to false, will use Data::Dump instead of the terser
    Data::Dump::OneLine to produce the dumps.

IMPORTS
    For each variable mentioned in "VARIABLES", you can also set it via
    import argument:

     use Carp::Always::Dump Color=>0, DumpObj=>1;

    Via command-line:

     % perl -MCarp::Always::Dump=Color,1 ...

ENVIRONMENT
  COLOR => BOOL
    Used to set the default of $Color.

  INTERACTIVE => BOOL
SEE ALSO
    Carp::Always (and its variants such as: Carp::Always::Color,
    Carp::Always::SHS)

    Devel::SimpleTrace, a simpler stack trace module, without showing
    function arguments.
